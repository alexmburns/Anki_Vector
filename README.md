# Anki_Vector
Some random scripts for Anki's Vector

attitude.py = Say "Hey Vector" and he will respond by saying "I'm getting a little fed up with all these demands"

dice.py = Type Y to roll a die or type N to exit the program. Vector will say the result of the die roll out loud.

guess.py = Vector will think of a number between 1 and 20. You have 5 guesses to find out what it is.

hangman.py = Vector will think of a word, guess what the word is. He'll be happy if you guess a letter correctly, unhappy if you get it wrong. Guess the whole word and he will loose his s***!

rainbow_eyes.py = Vector's eyes will cycle through all the colours within the rainbow whilst receiting a mnemonic.
